## Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping by MATLAB

MATLAB has an example of Monocular Visual SLAM linked [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/monocular-visual-simultaneous-localization-and-mapping.html). A summary of how the example works is in the [README](https://github.com/frankzachma/Visual-Mono-SLAM/blob/main/README.md).

The relevant results of this example from running it on my personal computer are the two pictures below. The first one (top) is the picture with the key points. The second one (bottom) is the optimized trajectory of the camera overlayed with the ground truth trajectory.
